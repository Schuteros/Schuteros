- 👋 Hi, I’m @Schuteros
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded systems and system programming making big applications like my own personal assistant.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, Python, HTML5 and C++ for embedded programing with AVR and Espressif microcontrollers. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything embedded or Rust.
